# SMU Coding Bootcamp Repo - Januay 2018

## About this Repository

This repository contains all of the in-class activities introduced during the January 2018 SMU Coding Bootcamp. There are two directories: "Unsolved" and "Solved"

### Unsolved Directory

This directory contains all of the activities introduced in class...WITHOUT solutions. The purposes of this directory is to review the in-class material and practice the topics that may have been harder to understand during the time it was introduced.


### Solved Directory

This directory contains all of the activities introduced in class...WITH solutions. The purpose of this directory is to check your (the developer) solution against what the instructor provided as their solution. Always remember there is more than one way to solve a problem when it comes to development.
